# md5-hash-breaker
This project brute-forces a short lowercase only password to a toy server. Password encoded using md5 hashing, and decodes on 16 threads in roughly 3~ days.

It also assumes that we have some how stolen the etc_password and etc_shadow of the linux system we're breaking into.

Built in collaboration by myself and Raymond Chlebeck
